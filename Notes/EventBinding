In Angular, Interpolation is the simplest way to display the data from the component (typescript) into view (HTML template)
-> component -> view 
{{value}}
This means (Take the variable called value from the component and show it in the HTML)

In angular, Property binding is used to send the data from the component > view and bind it to HTML element
[property] = value

In angular, Event binding is used to send data from view - component when user perofrms an action click, keyup, submit, etc..
(event)="method()"

In angular, two way binding means data flows both the ways
component to view,
view to component

When the user types in the UI, the component variable update
When the variable changes, the UI updates automatically
